# self-supervised-depth-completion

This repo contains the PyTorch implementation of our work on ["Self-supervised Sparse-to-Dense:  Self-supervised Depth Completion from LiDAR and Monocular Camera"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.00275.pdf) by [Fangchang Ma](http://www.mit.edu/~fcma/), Guilherme Venturelli Cavalheiro, and [Sertac Karaman](http://karaman.mit.edu/) at MIT. A video demonstration is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/bGXfvF261pc).
